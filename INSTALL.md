#Installation

As of Nov 19, 2016, there is no installation script or program.  Installation just involves cloning or downloading this repository, but, there is an important list of prerequisites.  You could consider these to be part of the installation procedure:

1. Python 3.4.2 or higher
2. Python modules
 * PyQt 5.4 or higher (pip install pyqt)
 * requests (pip install requests)
 * regex
 * xml.dom.minidom
 * parse
 * json

That should do it!  Just run 'python buckshot.py' to run the program.
